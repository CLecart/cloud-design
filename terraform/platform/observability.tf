# Observability on the AWS side:
#   - CloudWatch log group of the six services, filled by Fluent Bit
#     (Manifests/helm/fluent-bit.yaml) through EKS Pod Identity;
#   - a CloudWatch dashboard of the public entry (API Gateway) and of the
#     internal load balancer.
# Metrics and dashboards of the cluster itself come from Prometheus and Grafana
# (Manifests/helm/kube-prometheus-stack.yaml).
#
# Cost: log ingestion and storage stay within the 5 GB/month free tier (only the
# application containers are shipped, kept one day); AWS service metrics are free
# and the first three dashboards too.
